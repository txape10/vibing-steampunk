# CLAUDE.md

**vsp** — Go-native MCP server and CLI for SAP ABAP Development Tools (ADT).

> **Doc intent:** CLAUDE.md = dev context. README.md = user onboarding. reports/ = research/history. contexts/ = session handoff.

---

## Current Priorities

### 1. Bug #132 — ALL objects fail PUT with 423 (on-prem) — Investigation
**Scope correction (2026-05-27):** Initially reported as "transport-owned objects only" but confirmed to affect
**all** objects including `$TMP` locals. The lock is always acquired (valid handle returned) but the subsequent
PUT fails with `423 ExceptionResourceInvalidLockHandle`. `mcp-abap-abap-adt-api` works correctly for the same
lock+write sequence, proving the ADT API is fine and the bug is in vsp's session handling.
- Root cause: HTTP session/cookie affinity — SAP ENQUEUE lock is bound to the `sap-contextid` cookie of the
  session that created it. vsp loses that cookie between the LOCK POST and the UPDATE PUT even when both use
  `Stateful: true`. See `pkg/adt/http.go`.
- Guard fix (`&& result.CorrNr == ""`) is still correct — transport-owned objects no longer rejected upfront.
- Re-lock attempt (second POST with corrNr) also returns invalid handle — approach removed.
- **Next step:** intercept HTTP from `mcp-abap-abap-adt-api` (mitmproxy) and compare `sap-contextid` cookie
  between lock and PUT requests vs. vsp's requests.
- Investigation: [004](reports/2026-05-27-004-issue-132-investigation.md) | Issue: [#132](https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk/issues/132)
- Workaround: use `mcp-abap-abap-adt-api` for lock+write+unlock. See `~/.claude/sap-mcp-servers.md`.

### 2. Bug #133 — INCL package resolution + isClassInclude detection — FIXED (2026-05-27)
Two bugs found and fixed:
- `normalizeObjectURLForPackageCheck` stripped `/programs/includes/NAME` to `/programs` (matched the
  `/includes/` class-strip before the `/source/main` strip). Fix: reorder strips, scope `/includes/` strip
  to `/oo/classes/` URLs only. File: `pkg/adt/client.go`.
- `isClassInclude` in `EditSourceWithOptions` fired on any URL containing `/includes/`, making program
  includes skip `/source/main` and send wrong Accept header (406). Fix: require `/oo/classes/` too.
  File: `pkg/adt/workflows_edit.go`.
- Verified on-prem: source reads correctly (`matchCount: 1`). Write fails with #132 (same as CLAS) — not #133.
- Issue: [#133](https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk/issues/133)

### 3. Graph Engine (`pkg/graph/`) — In Progress
Sequence: unify existing dep logic → SQL/ADT adapters → impact/path queries.
- Done: core types, parser dep extraction, boundary analyzer (11 tests)
- Pending: SQL adapters (CROSS/WBCROSSGT/D010INC), ADT adapters, unify `cli_deps.go` + `cli_extra.go` + `ctxcomp/analyzer.go`
- Design: [002](reports/2026-04-05-002-graph-engine-design.md), [003](reports/2026-04-05-003-graph-engine-alignment-for-claude.md)

### 4. GUI Debugger (Issue #2) — Strategic
Plan: MCP debug sessions → DAP → Web UI. ADT REST API mapped from `CL_TPDA_ADT_RES_APP`. Design: [001](reports/2026-04-05-001-gui-debugger-design.md)

### 5. Open Issues
- **#88** Lock handle bug (EditSource/WriteSource) — same root cause as #132 (session affinity)
- **#55** RunReport in APC — architectural limit
- **#46** / **#45** Sync script flags — closed upstream (script never existed in public repo)

## Build & Test

```bash

| Task | Files |
|------|-------|
| Add MCP tool | `tools_register.go` + `handlers_*.go` + `tools_focused.go` |
| Add ADT operation | `pkg/adt/client.go`, `crud.go`, `devtools.go`, `codeintel.go` |
| Add graph feature | `pkg/graph/` |
| Add lint rule | `pkg/abaplint/rules.go` |
| Add integration test | `pkg/adt/integration_test.go` |
| Fix MCP/docs/config | `README.md`, `docs/cli-agents/*`, `handlers_universal.go` |

## Adding a New MCP Tool

1. Handler in `handlers_*.go`:
```go
func (s *Server) handleX(ctx context.Context, req mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    name, _ := req.GetArguments()["name"].(string)
    result, err := s.adtClient.Method(ctx, name)
    if err != nil { return newToolResultError(err.Error()), nil }
    return mcp.NewToolResultText(format(result)), nil
}
```
2. Register in `tools_register.go` with `shouldRegister("X")`
3. Route in `handlers_analysis.go` (or appropriate router)
4. Add to `tools_focused.go` if needed in focused mode

---

## Common Issues

1. **CSRF errors** — auto-refreshed in `http.go`
2. **Lock conflicts** — edit handler does auto lock/unlock
3. **Session issues** — some CRUD/debugger flows are session-sensitive; verify stateful/stateless before changing transport or auth logic
4. **Auth** — use basic OR cookies, not both
5. **ZADT_VSP** — WebSocket debug/RFC/RunReport require it installed on SAP

## Security

Never commit `.env`, `cookies.txt`, `.mcp.json`, or local agent/MCP config files (all in `.gitignore`).

### Sanitize policy for tracked docs, tests, and examples

The public repo must not contain concrete identifiers that tie code or
docs to a live SAP system, a real user, or a customer's ABAP namespace.
Anything that does belongs under `.local/` (gitignored) and never in
`contexts/`, `reports/`, `docs/`, or any tracked test fixture.

**Never in tracked files:**
- Real SAP usernames — use `TESTUSER`
- Real hostnames or IPs — use `dev.example.local`, `prodsys-a.example`, `trialsys.example`
- System aliases that name a live box — use `devsys`, `devsys-adt`, `prodsys-a`, `prodsys-b`
- Live transport numbers (`DEVK[0-9]+`, `R[0-9]{2}K[0-9]+`, `D[0-9]{2}K[0-9]+`) — use `TR-EXAMPLE`
- Live change request IDs — use `CR-EXAMPLE`
- Customer ABAP namespaces from real projects — use synthetic `ZDEMO_*`, `ZCL_DEMO_*`, `ZIF_DEMO_*`, `$ZDEMO`
- Customer transport attribute names — use `Z_CR_ATTR`
- Real passwords, API keys, bearer tokens (obvious, but stated)
- Real person names tied to private systems (OSS attribution for upstream libraries is fine — "user X on private host Y" is not)

**Always OK in tracked files:**
- `$ZHIRTEST*`, `ZCL_HIRT*`, `ZCUSTOM_DEVELOPMENT` — pre-agreed synthetic fixtures
- Public GitHub handles that are already in the Go module path
- Upstream OSS attribution for library authors

**Operational scratch goes under `.local/`** — session notes, live CR
dumps, bug repros with real identifiers, debugging transcripts. The
`.local/` dir is gitignored. If you need to reference it from a
tracked doc, redact first.

**Before every commit that touches `reports/`, `contexts/`, `docs/`,
or test fixtures:** scan the staged diff for the identifier families
above. The detection signature (concrete literal list of past-leaked
strings) lives at `.local/scripts/check-identifiers.sh` and is
gitignored on purpose — the signature itself would otherwise be the
leak it is trying to prevent. Structural patterns safe to commit:

```bash
git diff --cached | grep -nE \
  '\b[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\b|' \
  '\b[A-Z][0-9]{2}K[0-9]{6}\b|' \
  '\bDEVK[0-9]{6,}\b'
```

That catches IPv4 literals and SAP transport IDs without hardcoding
a specific customer's values. Pair it with the private signature
file for the names-based families (usernames, hostnames, ABAP object
prefixes). If either matches, move the content under `.local/` and
replace the tracked version with a synthetic placeholder. Rule of
thumb: "would a stranger reading this file be able to identify the
customer, the system, or a live account?" If yes, redact.

## Conventions

Reports: `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-title.md`. SAP objects: `ZADT_<nn>_<name>`, `ZCL_ADT_<name>`, packages `$ZADT*`.

## Areas Requiring Care

| Area | Risk | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `pkg/graph/` | New, incomplete | Only parser adapter; SQL/ADT adapters pending |
| `handlers_debugger.go` | WebSocket-only | REST breakpoints 403 on newer SAP; use ZADT_VSP |
| `handlers_amdp.go` | Experimental | Session works, breakpoints unreliable |
| `pkg/adt/ui5.go` | Read-only | Write needs `/UI5/CL_REPOSITORY_LOAD` |
| `pkg/llvm2abap/`, `pkg/wasmcomp/` | Research | Not production; don't treat as stable |
| `pkg/adt/debugger.go` (REST) | Deprecated | Prefer `websocket_debug.go` |
| `docs/cli-agents/*` | Config drift | Codex TOML format may differ from Claude/Gemini JSON docs |
