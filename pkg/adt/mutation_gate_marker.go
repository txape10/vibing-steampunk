// --- Per-object package-check marker (issue #91) ---
//
// Of the three steps in checkMutation only step 2 — the package ownership
// check — ever leaves the process: for an existing object it resolves the
// package through SearchObject, an explicitly *stateless* ADT request.
//
// A lock handle from `?_action=LOCK` is bound to the stateful ADT session it
// was issued in. A stateless request retires that session server-side, so a
// package lookup performed between the LOCK and the write that consumes the
// handle kills the handle, and the write comes back
// 423 ExceptionResourceInvalidLockHandle.
//
// Outer workflows that have already resolved and approved the package of a
// specific object mark the context. checkMutation then skips *only* the
// networked lookup, and *only* for that object. Steps 1 and 3 (operation type
// and transportable-edit policy) are pure config predicates that issue no
// request, so they always run — skipping them, as the old mutationGateSkipKey
// mechanism did, would turn a session fix into a --read-only /
// --disallowed-ops / --allow-transportable-edits bypass.

// mutationPackageCheckedKey is the context key under which the set of
// already-approved object keys is carried.

// mutationPackageKey is the canonical identity used to match a marked object
// against the object an inner mutator is about to touch. It is the same
// normalisation getObjectPackage resolves against, so a class, its
// /source/main and its /includes/<part> all collapse to one key — which is
// correct, because ADT resolves the package of an include from its parent.
