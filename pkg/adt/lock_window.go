// lockWindowMaxAge bounds how long a recorded lock can suppress the keep-alive
// ping. Nothing here can prove a lock was released — a delete consumes the
// handle, a failed unlock leaves it held by a session that may already be gone,
// and a caller can drop a handle on the floor. So an entry that is never closed
// expires instead of suppressing the ping forever. Thirty minutes sits under
// SAP's own ADT session timeout (typically ~60), which is the point past which
// a lock this client is still tracking cannot be alive anyway.

// lockWindow records the lock handles this client believes are outstanding.

// Its only consumer is the keep-alive ticker. A keep-alive ping is a request
// like any other, and under the stateless default an unflagged request is not
// answered on the stateful ADT session a lock handle is bound to — it retires
// it. A ping that lands between LOCK and the write therefore kills the handle
// and the write returns 423, which is issue #168: a keep-alive that kills the
// session it exists to keep alive.
//
// Suppressing a tick is free. Sending one at the wrong moment costs a write.
// So this errs toward suppression: it clears an entry only on a *successful*
// unlock or delete, and lets anything else age out.
