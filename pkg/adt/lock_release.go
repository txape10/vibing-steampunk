// package used to reuse the enclosing ctx, so when the mutation failed
// *because* the context was cancelled or hit its deadline — an MCP client
// timeout, a Ctrl-C, an HTTP deadline — the unlock never left the process. It
// failed at http.NewRequestWithContext before a byte was sent, and the
// ENQUEUE it was meant to release stayed on the object. A timeout inside a
// lock window was a guaranteed leak.
//
// The returned error is the caller's only evidence that an object was left
// locked; do not discard it. strandedLockAdvice turns it into something a
// user can act on.

// The failure mode this exists for is issue #91: the mutation returned 423

// and UNLOCK cannot work either, because `_action=UNLOCK` addresses the
// ENQUEUE only through that handle and that session. The lock is real, it
// belongs to the user's own session, no vsp command can clear it, and the
// next edit will fail with SAP's "is currently editing" message naming the
// user themselves — which reads exactly like a colleague holding the object.
// Every one of those facts has to be in the message or the user is left
// where the issue reporters were: at SM12, guessing.
